# 📡 LoRa Sensor Node PCB Design – Assignment Submission by Antrali

This repository contains my submission for the LoRa-based sensor node PCB design assignment, created using **KiCad EDA 9.0.1**.

---

## ✅ Task Overview

As instructed, I designed a PCB for the provided circuit (`LORA_ckt.pdf`) while meeting the specific requirements:
- **Board dimensions**: 30 mm x 55 mm
- **Spacing between ESP32 header rails**: 15.24 mm
- **Optimized component placement and routing**

This submission reflects my understanding of PCB design principles, efficient layout management and attention to design constraints.
